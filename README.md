1 - Install Apache Spark dependencies.
Proceed with installing it.

2 - Install Apache Spark. (Im opted for the "Stand Alone Cluster" Mode, as it suited me, but feel free to check and suggest other simpler and more efficient installation modes).

3 - If, like me, you chose the "Stand Alone" mode, follow the steps in the documentation.

Doc. Link:
https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html

4 - After installation, the cluster will be able to run and perform its proper functions, run your startup script "start-all.sh" and wait. (Access can be done via WebUi, or through the terminal, at your discretion).

5 - With the cluster in full operation, submit your applications through "spark-submit".

6 - To shut down the entire cluster, run "stop-all.sh".

Link to databases

1 - Community Mobility Reports (Br).
Database: Google.

2 - Variation of Cases (Covid-19).
Database: Fiocruz.

Period: January/2020 - December/2020.

However, it can be easily extrapolated, due to constant data updates.

The ETL process was done through Apache Spark, but specifically with PySpark, and other awesome Python tools.
